-Answer of the first question

Commands to know the average of each characteristic of the songs
SELECT AVG(energy) AS avg_energy, AVG(valence) AS avg_valence, AVG(danceability) AS avg_danceability,
       AVG(tempo) AS avg_tempo, AVG(speechiness) AS avg_speechiness
FROM songs;

-- Answer of the second question
A better way to calculate the aura of the user is to incorperate other factors such as melody, harmony,
 lyrics, instrumentation, and arrangement, among others, when analyzing the audio aura of a listener's top songs, also this aura calculation can differ drasticly upon other factors that are not calculated here like personal preferences and cultural background and context.
