Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
- At N = 10, Spain was the winner However, after I start to increase N, Belgium would become the winner at each time !,
 In addition that spain would be most of the time (any number of simulations above 10) in the fourth place.

 - Portugal would come at the second at N = 10 and at N = 100, However,
  After I increased the number of simulations byond 100, It would become on the Third place each time.

- Colombia had 10% chance of winning at N = 10, However, after I increased N, it would not exceed a chance of 2%

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: After 100000 simulations,
 as after that number, my program start to take more compute time than 1 second !
